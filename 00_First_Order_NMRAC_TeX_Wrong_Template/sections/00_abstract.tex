\begin{abstract}
Lyapunov-based Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) is a well known and widely spread control strategy, that by design comes with stability guarantees. However, it does not allow for nonlinearities being present in the closed-loop system, which limits its application to linear systems with linear feedback controllers. In this work, a Lyapunov-based update mechanism for first-order systems controlled by Neural Network controllers (NNC) is proposed. The update mechanism is validated in simulation for a constant reference signal, a sinusodial reference signal, and a smooth pulse signal. The numerical results show that the propsed algorithm converges towards the desired values and that the speed of convergence can be tuned by manipulating the learning rate. Additionally, this work identifies numerical instabilities as a potential issue, which can be reduced by reducing the sampling time. \newline
