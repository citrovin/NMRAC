\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The simulation results of the scalar system strongly indicate that the proposed update law successfully enables the system to learn the desired parameters across different reference signals. The speed of convergence can be influenced by adjusting the learning rate $c$, with smaller values leading to faster convergence and larger values leading to slower convergence. Another observation that does not become evident in the presented simulations, is that the proposed update is sensitive to numerical instabilities. However, this instability can be reduced by lowering the sampling time, thus enhancing the precision of integral and derivative approximations, improving overall simulation accuracy. Future work will focus on tackling these numerical instabilities and developing update laws for more complex systems.
