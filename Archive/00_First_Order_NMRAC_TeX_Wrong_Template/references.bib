	abstract = {PID controllers are among the most popular control strategies used in industry. However, one of their main limitations is often the diﬀiculty to tune them properly to achieve the best possible performance. Therefore, adaptive PID methods have been developed, such as PID neural networks (PIDNN). The gains are often tuned by minimizing the error between the desired output and the system’s output, using a gradient descent-based algorithm. We propose an enhanced PIDNN controller (EPIDNNC) that introduces a reference model, to teach the controller a desired response. This work is successfully applied to a nonlinear system, an inverted pendulum, whose dynamics and parameters are unknown to the controller. Our EPIDNNC method is superior to the standard PIDNNC, due to 1) better performance, with respect to overshoot, steady-state error, settling time, and oscillatory behavior, and 2) a new versatile update law, allowing changes in the reference model dynamics.},

RNNs have excellent expressive power but lack the stability or robustness guarantees that are necessary for many applications. In this paper, we formulate convex sets of RNNs with stability and robustness guarantees. The guarantees are derived using incremental quadratic constraints and can ensure global exponential stability of all solutions, and bounds on incremental 2 gain (the Lipschitz constant of the learned sequence-to-sequence mapping). Using an implicit model structure, we construct a parametrization of RNNs that is jointly convex in the model parameters and stability certiﬁcate. We prove that this model structure includes all previouslyproposed convex sets of stable RNNs as special cases, and also includes all stable linear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of the proposed model class in the context of non-linear system identiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {The MIT rule is a scalar parameter adjustment law which was proposed in 1961 for the model reference adaptive control of linear systems modeled as the cascade of a known stable plant and a single unknown gain. This adjustment law was derived by approximating a gradient descent procedure for an integral error squared performance criterion. For the early part of the 1960s this rule was the basis of many adaptive control schemes and a considerable wealth of practical experience and engineering folklore was amassed. The MIT rule is in general not globally convergent nor stable but has a performance determined by several factors such as algorithm gain, reference input magnitude and frequency, and the particular transfer function appearing in the cascade. These restrictions on the MIT rule slowly came to be discerned through experimentation and simulation but effectively were without theoretical support until some novel algorithm modifications and stability analysis, so-called Lyapunov redesign, due to Parks. Our aim in this paper is to pursue a theoretical analysis of the original MIT rule to support the existing simulation evidence and to indicate mechanisms for treating questions of robustness of MIT-rule-based adaptive controllers with undermodelling effects. The techniques that we apply to this problem centre on root locus methods, Nyquist methods and the application of the theory of averaging. Stability and instability results are presented and, using pertinent theories for different regimes of the gain-frequency plane, we approximate the experimentally derived stability margins, but for a broader signal class than simply periodic inputs. The mechanisms of instability and stability for these adaptive systems are highlighted and allow us to enunciate guidelines for the MIT rule to work. It is a pleasing by-product of this theoretical analysis that these guidelines coincide to a large degree with those advanced in earlier times on experimental and heuristic grounds.},

The method prevents generation of high frequency oscillations that are unavoidable in conventional MRAC systems for large adaptation rates. The provided design guideline makes it possible to track a reference command of any magnitude form any initial position without re-tuning. The benefits of the method are demonstrated in simulations.},

Until now, Barbalat’s Lemma, was commonly used to prove asymptotic convergence of the tracking error in these systems. One of the disadvantages of this Lemma is the imposition of strict condition of uniform continuity that restricts the use of this Lemma. In addition, this Lemma does not provide any result about convergence of adaptive gains. For this reason, until now it has been difficult and even mostly impossible to achieve the desired result of asymptotic stability for the MRAC by using methods based on the Barbalat’s Lemma. The new Theorem of Stability is a direct extension of the Lyapunov method, which under very simple initial conditions and without the need for uniform continuity yields to more comprehensive results for all the states of the adaptive system and even in some cases results in asymptotic stability. In this paper, first, the new Theorem of Stability and its benefits are described and then, the stability analysis of the MRAC is performed by this new method and under simple conditions, the result of asymptotic stability for this adaptive system is obtained which is a very desirable result. Simulation of a single-link flexible-joint robot with MRAC has confirmed the accuracy of the performed stability analysis.},

A stable controller-parameter adjustment mechanism, which is determined using the Lyapunov theory, is constructed using a -modification-type updating law.

That is, the control error converges asymptotically to a neighborhood of zero, whose size is evaluated and depends on the approximation error of the neural network.

This adaptive control scheme was used to control a relatively complex process like the pH of a solution in a tank reactor at laboratory level. For comparison purposes, some very well-known control strategies were also implemented, which include PID control and standard model reference adaptive control (MRAC). Tracking and regulation capabilities of the control strategies studied were analysed and compared. Experimental results indicate that CMRAC behaves as well as the standard MRAC and a very well-tuned PID for a specific and known operating point. Advantages of the adaptive controllers are shown when the operating point changes. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose To apply and simulate under different conditions, the combined model reference adaptive control (CMRAC) technique to control the pitch angle in a subsonic plane. Comparisons with the classical PID controller and the adaptive direct MRAC are also performed. Design/methodology/approach The methodology used in this work is the CMRAC. This is a relatively new adaptive control technique which combines the information coming from the identification procedure as well as that from the direct control scheme, and use it in the adaptive laws. The identification parameters and the controller parameters are simultaneously adjusted using the identification error, the control error and the so‐called close‐loop identification error. This combination has shown to improve the transient behavior of the adaptive systems. Findings This control scheme has been tested by simulation on a model of a CESSNA 182 plane, to control the pitch angle (longitudinal movement). The results have been compared with other control approaches such as the classical PID and the adaptive direct MRAC. Although the PID control satisfies all the control specifications as much as the CMRAC, it is not able to adapt when changes in the operating conditions occur, as in the case of the CMRAC. The direct MRAC does no perform well in this study. Research limitations/implications The implementation at practical level remains to be studied and analyzed, to verify the theoretical and simulation results presented here. Practical implications The main advantage of the proposed method is that it behaves well even under different operating conditions, which is one of the most important characteristics for an implementation at practical level. Originality/value It is the first time in the control literature that the CMRAC is applied to control the pitch angle of a plane in a longitudinal movement. The results are quite promising remaining the practical implementation to verify the performance of the proposed scheme under real conditions.},

The proposed methods are applied to a numerical example and compared against each other.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a deﬁnition of phase for a class of stable nonlinear systems called semi-sectorial systems, from an input-output perspective. The deﬁnition involves the Hilbert transform as a critical instrument to complexify realvalued signals since the notion of phase arises most naturally in the complex domain. The proposed nonlinear system phase, serving as a counterpart of L2-gain, quantiﬁes the passivity and is highly related to the dissipativity. It also possesses a nice physical interpretation which quantiﬁes the tradeoff between the real energy and reactive energy. A nonlinear small phase theorem is then established for feedback stability analysis of semi-sectorial systems. Additionally, its generalized version is proposed via the use of multipliers. These nonlinear small phase theorems generalize a version of the classical passivity theorem and a recently appeared linear time-invariant small phase theorem.},

Online learning is based on two theorems which provide Lyapunov proofs and guarantees of convergence for the tracking error between the desired and the real dynamics. The results presented in this work show that the proposed online-learning algorithm yields significant improvements in the tracking of the desired trajectory, even in the case of a fault in one of the actuators.

These flying machines are capable of vertical take off and landing (VTOL) in helicopter mode and able to transition to high-speed forward flight in airplane mode and vice versa. This paper aims at helping engineers and researchers develop flight control systems for VTOL UAVs. To this end, a historical perspective first shows the technological advances in VTOL aircraft over the years. The main VTOL concepts and state-of-art flight control methods for VTOL UAVs are presented and discussed. This study shows both the common parts and the fundamental differences in the modeling, guidance, control, and control allocation for each hybrid-VTOL-UAV type. The open challenges and the current trends in the field are highlighted. These are namely: 1) augmenting or replacing classical controllers with data-driven methods such as neural networks and machine-learning-based controllers; 2) incorporating as much knowledge of the vehicle as possible into the flight controller, for example through model predictive control or model-based nonlinear controllers; 3) a trend towards finding a unified-control approach valid in all flight modes without the need to switch among flight controllers or to perform predefined-gain scheduling, and 4) the need to mitigate control complexity and available computing resources.},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones have emerged as a ubiquitous and integral part of our society. They appear in great diversity in a multiplicity of applications for economic, commercial, leisure, military and academic purposes. The drone industry has seen a sharp uptake in the last decade as a model to manufacture and deliver convergence, offering synergy by incorporating multiple technologies. It is due to technological trends and rapid advancements in control, miniaturization, and computerization, which culminate in secure, lightweight, robust, more-accessible and cost-efficient UAVs. UAVs support implicit particularities including access to disaster-stricken zones, swift mobility, airborne missions and payload features. Despite these appealing benefits, UAVs face limitations in operability due to several critical concerns in terms of flight autonomy, path planning, battery endurance, flight time and limited payload carrying capability, as intuitively it is not recommended to load heavy objects such as batteries. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to provide insights into the potentials of UAVs, as well as their characteristics and functionality issues. This study provides a comprehensive review of UAVs, types, swarms, classifications, charging methods and regulations. Moreover, application scenarios, potential challenges and security issues are also examined. Finally, future research directions are identified to further hone the research work. We believe these insights will serve as guidelines and motivations for relevant researchers.},

The NN has two layers so that linearity in the parameters holds, but the "net functional reconstruction error" and robot disturbance input are taken as nonzero. The structure of the NN controller is derived using a filtered error/passivity approach, leading to new NN passivity properties. Online weight tuning algorithms including a correction term to backpropagation, plus an added robustifying signal, guarantee tracking as well as bounded NN weights. The NN controller structure has an outer tracking loop so that the NN weights are conveniently initialized at zero, with learning occurring online in real-time. It is shown that standard backpropagation, when used for real-time closed-loop control, can yield unbounded NN weights if (1) the net cannot exactly reconstruct a certain required control function or (2) there are bounded unknown disturbances in the robot dynamics. The role of persistency of excitation is explored.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

To validate our theoretical statements, we develop an exemplary excitation procedure based on our conditions using a feed-forward control approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a nonzerosum differential game. In this setting, our approach outperforms commonly used probing noise in terms of convergence time and the degree of PE, shown by a numerical example.},

The method only requires the knowledge of a ﬁnite collection of one-step transitions of the discrete-time dynamics, without the requirement of segments of trajectories or the control inputs that eﬀected the transitions to be available. The approach uses a novel characterization of the MPI and MCI sets as the solution to an inﬁnite-dimensional linear programming (LP) problem in the space of continuous functions, with the optimum being attained by a (Lipschitz) continuous function under mild assumptions. The inﬁnitedimensional LP is then approximated by restricting the decision variable to a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and by imposing the non-negativity constraint of this LP only on the available data samples. This leads to a single ﬁnite-dimensional LP that can be easily solved using oﬀ-the-shelf solvers. We analyze the convergence rate and sample complexity, proving probabilistic as well as hard guarantees on the volume error of the approximations. The approach is very general, requiring minimal underlying assumptions. In particular, the dynamics is not required to be polynomial or even continuous (forgoing some of the theoretical results). Detailed numerical examples up to state-space dimension ten with code available online demonstrate the method1.},

	abstract = {Tight estimation of the Lipschitz constant for deep neural networks (DNNs) is useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of classifiers to stability analysis of closed-loop systems with reinforcement learning controllers. Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation).  We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2102.02273},
	abstract = {This work makes several contributions on stability and performance verification of nonlinear dynamical systems controlled by neural networks. First, we show that the stability and performance of a polynomial dynamical system controlled by a neural network with semialgebraically representable activation functions (e.g., ReLU) can be certified by convex semidefinite programming. The result is based on the fact that the semialgebraic representation of the activation functions and polynomial dynamics allows one to search for a Lyapunov function using polynomial sum-of-squares methods. Second, we remark that even in the case of a linear system controlled by a neural network with ReLU activation functions, the problem of verifying asymptotic stability is undecidable. Finally, under additional assumptions, we establish a converse result on the existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function for this class of systems. Numerical results with code available online on examples of state-space dimension up to 50 and neural networks with several hundred neurons and up to 30 layers demonstrate the method.},

	abstract = {Certifying the safety or robustness of neural networks against input uncertainties and adversarial attacks is an emerging challenge in the area of safe machine learning and control. To provide such a guarantee, one must be able to bound the output of neural networks when their input changes within a bounded set. In this article, we propose a semideﬁnite programming (SDP) framework to address this problem for feed-forward neural networks with general activation functions and input uncertainty sets. Our main idea is to abstract various properties of activation functions (e.g., monotonicity, bounded slope, bounded values, and repetition across layers) with the formalism of quadratic constraints. We then analyze the safety properties of the abstracted network via the S-procedure and SDP. Our framework spans the tradeoff between conservatism and computational efﬁciency and applies to problems beyond safety veriﬁcation. We evaluate the performance of our approach via numerical problem instances of various sizes.},

The closed-loop properties amenable to the proposed technique include global and local stability, performance with respect to a given cost function (both in a deterministic and stochastic setting) and the L2 gain. The method applies to a wide range of practical control problems: For instance, a dynamical controller (e.g., a PID) plus input saturation, model predictive control with state estimation, inexact model and soft constraints, or a general optimization-based controller where the underlying problem is solved with a fixed number of iterations of a first-order method are all amenable to the proposed approach. The approach is based on the observation that the control input generated by an optimization-based controller satisfies the associated Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions which, provided all data is polynomial, are a system of polynomial equalities and inequalities. The closed-loop properties can then be analyzed using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming.},

A novel pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) actuator which has achieved increased popularity to provide the inherent safety and mobility assistance to humans performing tasks and another advantages such as high strength and power/weight ratio, low cost, compactness, ease of maintenance, cleanliness, readily available and cheap power source and so on. However, the complex nonlinear dynamics of the PAM manipulator makes it a challenging and appealing system for modeling and control design. The problems with the time variance, compliance, high hysteresis and nonlinearity of pneumatic systems have made it difficult to realize precise position control. In order to realize satisfactory control performance, the effect of nonlinear factors contained in the PAM manipulator must be considered. The purpose of this study is to improve the control performance of 2 axes PAM manipulator using a nonlinear PID controller. Superb mixture of conventional PID controller and the neural network, which has powerful capability of learning, adaptation and tackling nonlinearity, brings us a novel nonlinear PID controller using neural network. This proposed controller is appropriate for a kind of plants with nonlinearity uncertainties and disturbances. The experiments were carried out in practical 2 axes PAM manipulator and the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm was demonstrated through the experiments, which suggests its superior performance and disturbance rejection.},

Such a special structure makes the exterior feature of the neural network controller able to become a P, PI, PD, or PID controller as needed. The closed-loop error between directly measured output and expected value of the system is chosen to be the input of the controller. Only a group of initial weights values, which can run the controlled closed-loop system stably, are required to be determined. The proposed controller can update weights of the neural network online according to errors caused by uncertain factors of system such as modeling error and external disturbance, based on stable learning rate. The resilient back-propagation algorithm with sign instead of the gradient is used to update the network weights. The basic ideas, techniques, and system stability proof were presented in detail. Finally, actual experiments both of single and double inverted pendulums were implemented, and the comparison of effectiveness between the proposed controller and the linear optimal regulator were given.},

RNNs have excellent expressive power but lack the stability or robustness guarantees that are necessary for many applications. In this paper, we formulate convex sets of RNNs with stability and robustness guarantees. The guarantees are derived using incremental quadratic constraints and can ensure global exponential stability of all solutions, and bounds on incremental 2 gain (the Lipschitz constant of the learned sequence-to-sequence mapping). Using an implicit model structure, we construct a parametrization of RNNs that is jointly convex in the model parameters and stability certiﬁcate. We prove that this model structure includes all previouslyproposed convex sets of stable RNNs as special cases, and also includes all stable linear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of the proposed model class in the context of non-linear system identiﬁcation.},

In the conventional MRAC scheme, the controller is designed to realize the plant output convergence to the reference model output based on the assumption that the plant can be linearized. This scheme is eﬀective for controlling a linear plant with unknown parameters in the ideal case. However, it may not be assured to succeed in controlling a nonlinear plant with unknown structures in the real case. We incorporate a neural network in the MRAC to overcome this problem. The control input is given by the sum of the output of the adaptive controller and the output of the NN. The NN is used to compensate for the nonlinearity of the plant that is not taken into consideration in the conventional MRAC. We developed an eﬃcient method for calculating the sensitivity of the plant that is utilized in the NN to perform the backpropagation algorithm very eﬃciently. The plant of the magnetic levitation system has inherent strong nonlinearities due to the natural properties of the magnetic ﬁelds and uncertainties. Therefore, to conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness of our proposed controller, we implemented our proposed controller in real time on an experimental test bed of a magnetic levitation system. Finally, experimental results veriﬁed that the proposed control strategy has the advantages of tracking desired output perfectly and reducing the error.},

initialization parameters of the neural controller using reduced

The stable controller-parameters adjustment mechanism is determined using the convergence of the synaptic weights of the RBF model. The evaluation of tracking error between the system output and that of the neural network desired reference model depends on the approximation error of the RBF model. Updating of the RBF neural network width, center, and weight characteristics is performed such that control error reduction and improved tracking accuracy are accomplished. The control signal obtained can make the real system close to the reference model.},

A supervised neural dynamic programming (SNDP) approach is developed to solve this MRAC problem, which includes a learning mode and a control mode. In the learning mode, a data-based adaptive critic learning algorithm is proposed, which guarantees that the controlled objective adaptively tracks the reference model on behavior. Such an algorithm also ensures flexible switching from the learning mode to the control mode under which the robustness of the closed-loop control systems is further improved. By employing a newly defined mode scheduler that regulates the learning mode and the control mode, the adaptation and the robustness of the systems are both achieved by the developed SNDP approach. Its uniformly ultimately bounded property is proved by using Lyapunov method. Simulation results verify that the developed SNDP approach ensures the adaptation to the variable reference input, and has superiority over some traditional MRAC methods in improving the robustness.},

	abstract = {As a powerful method of solving the nonlinear optimal control problem, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming (IADP) is usually established on the known controlled system model and is particular for affine nonlinear systems. Since most nonlinear systems are complicated to establish accurate mathematical models, this paper provides a novel data-based approximate optimal control algorithm, named iterative neural dynamic programming (INDP) for affine and non-affine nonlinear systems by using system data rather than accurate system models. The INDP strategy is built within the framework of IADP, where the convergence guarantee of the iteration is provided. The INDP algorithm is implemented based on the model-based heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) structure, where model, action and critic neural networks are employed to approximate the system dynamics, the control law and the iterative cost function, respectively. During the back-propagation of action and critic networks, the approach of directly minimizing the iterative cost function is developed to eliminate the requirement of establishing system models. The neural network implementation of the INDP algorithm is presented in detail and the associated stability is also analyzed. Simulation studies are conducted on affine and non-affine nonlinear systems, and further on the manipulator system, where all results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed data-based approximate optimal control method.},

	abstract = {Want to know not just what makes rockets go up but how to do it optimally? Optimal control theory has become such an important field in aerospace engineering that no graduate student or practicing engineer can afford to be without a working knowledge of it. This is the first book that begins from scratch to teach the reader the basic principles of the calculus of variations, develop the necessary conditions step-by-step, and introduce the elementary computational techniques of optimal control. This book, with problems and an online solution manual, provides the graduate-level reader with enough introductory knowledge so that he or she can not only read the literature and study the next level textbook but can also apply the theory to find optimal solutions in practice. No more is needed than the usual background of an undergraduate engineering, science, or mathematics program: namely calculus, differential equations, and numerical integration. Although finding optimal solutions for these problems is a complex process involving the calculus of variations, the authors carefully lay out step-by-step the most important theorems and concepts. Numerous examples are worked to demonstrate how to apply the theories to everything from classical problems (e.g., crossing a river in minimum time) to engineering problems (e.g., minimum-fuel launch of a satellite). Throughout the book use is made of the time-optimal launch of a satellite into orbit as an important case study with detailed analysis of two examples: launch from the Moon and launch from Earth. For launching into the field of optimal solutions, look no further! .},

Linearization of the dynamics of the pendubot about this equilibrium results in a completely controllable system and allows a linear controller to be designed for local asymptotic stability. For the underactuated pendubot, the important task is, therefore, to design a controller that will swing up both links and bring the configuration variables of the system within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. This paper provides a new method for swing-up control based on a series of rest-to-rest maneuvers of the first link about its vertically upright configuration. The rest-to-rest maneuvers are designed such that each maneuver results in a net gain in energy of the second link. This results in swing-up of the second link and the pendubot configuration reaching the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. A four-step algorithm is provided for swing-up control followed by stabilization. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.},

In this paper, an intelligent control method is developed for stabilizing such the RIP system in upright posture. The controller is structured from a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and an online radial basis function (RBF) Neural-Network compensator. The LQR term plays a crucial role in yielding the nominal control signal based on a linearized model. Meanwhile, the neural control term is adopted to suppress the systematic deviation and external disturbances as the system is far from the equilibrium state. A damping segment-wise adaptation rule is proposed to activate the network operation. Stability of the closed-loop system is then proven by Lyapunov analyses. Effectiveness and feasibility of the advanced controller are confirmed throughout comparative simulation and real-time experiments.},

	abstract = {The control strategy for a two-wheeled robot is still continuously researched and developed due to its natural behavior (unstable and non-linear). In this research, the Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) using the Lyapunov stability theorem was applied in a two-wheeled robot. MRAC was used to design adaptive controllers that work on the principle of adjusting controller parameters so that the actual output traces the output of the reference model, which has the same reference input. The adjusting mechanism was built to ensure stability and convergence from the adaptation errors. The verification experiment showed that with the adaptation gain γ1, γ2, γ3 are 1, 0.005 and 0.001 respectively, the response could follow the reference model with a rising time and settling time 0.27 s and 0.87 s, respectively.},

	abstract = {The article applies the robust generalized dynamic inversion control methodology to the problem of stabilizing upright equilibrium configuration of the under-actuated rotary inverted pendulum system while tracking rotary motion of the actuated arm. The proposed robust generalized dynamic inversion control law comprised equivalent and switching control parts. The equivalent control part works to enforce a virtual constraint dynamics of the controlled state variables by means of Moore–Penrose generalized inversion. The switching control part is of the sliding mode type, and it improves robustness against unmodeled system dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances. The robust generalized dynamic inversion control design on the linearized model of the under-actuated rotary inverted pendulum is shown to guarantee semi-global asymptotically stable tracking performance. Numerous computer simulations and experiments are conducted on the Quanser rotary inverted pendulum system, revealing that the proposed algorithm has better convergence and tracking performance than conventional sliding mode and generalized dynamic inversion control strategies when both are applied separately.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design of a robust direct model reference adaptive control (DMRAC) algorithm with focus on the satisfaction of an almost strictly positive real (ASPR) condition over the maximal range of parameter variations of the plant, and its application to an inverted pendulum. To alleviate the ASPR condition, the pendulum is augmented with a feedforward compensator optimized for robustness. A DMRAC algorithm ensuring asymptotic model following is then integrated with the feedforward compensator design. These new experimental results validate the algorithm's use and applicability to the control of an inverted pendulum with a variety of parameter uncertainties.
Résumé
On presente la conception d'un algorithme robuste de reglage adaptif a 'reference au modele directe (DMRAC) qui dois satisfaire la condition de realization positive presque partout (PPP) et son application a un pendule renverse. Pour alleger la condition PPP, le pendule est ameliore' par l'ajout d'un compensateur "feed-forward" qui est optimise' pour la robustess. Puis, un algorithme DMRAC qui assure que la modele soit suivi asymptotiquement est integre' dans la realisation du compensateur. Les nouvaux resultats experimentaux verifient l'usage et l'application de l'algorithme pour regler le pendule renverse' avec des incretitudes sur les valeurs des parametres.},

	abstract = {For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},
