\section{Introduction}
Model reference control is a technique that imposes a behavior on a system, by equating the output of the model reference to the output of the controlled system. This way, the gains of a pre-defined controller structure can be found. 

However, this only works if the system's dynamics are known exactly, which is often far from reality. If the system's dynamics are not fully known, the controller gains can be found adaptively by a technique called \textit{model reference adaptive control} (MRAC). The adaptation law can be chosen either by 1) a gradient descent-based update law as first proposed by Whitaker et al. \cite{whitaker1959adaptive} and applied in for example \cite{wahby_enhanced_2024, bosshartComparisonTwoPID2021}, or 2) a Lyapunov-based update law as proposed by Shackcloth et al. \cite{shackclothSynthesisModelReference1965}. The latter enforces that in every update step, the control law is stabilizing, which is not guaranteed when using the former. In this work, a Lyapunov-based update law is used, to guarantee stability during the learning process.

Neural networks (NN) are ideal candidate functions for control laws since they can be considered to be universal approximators \cite{hornikUniversalApproximationUnknown1990a}. Since at least the 90s, research has been conducted on neural network-based controllers (NNC) \cite{jiangBriefReviewNeural2017}, and it has been shown that they can learn a desired behavior, for example in \cite{wahby_enhanced_2024, norrisNeuralNetworksControl2021}. However, standard NNs are nonlinear, through the use of nonlinear activation functions, which makes their formal verification challenging. They often rely on post-training stability verification, as done in \cite{kordaStabilityPerformanceVerification2022, revay_convex_2021}, which does not support any type of online learning for improving the control strategy, while guaranteeing a stabilizing controller.

The algorithm, proposed in this paper, is derived from a Lyapunov-based, linear MRAC, as in \cite{lavretskyCombinedCompositeModel2009, slamaModelReferenceAdaptive2018,astromAdaptiveControl2008} for example, and defines a stable learning strategy for first-order systems controlled by NNs.

This paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:related-work} highlights where this work can be positioned within existing literature, and Section \ref{sec:contributions} states the contributions. Subsequently, required definitions are introduced in Section \ref{sec:definitions}. This is followed by the proposed framework in Section \ref{sec:NMRAC}, with numerical results in Section \ref{sec:results}, and a discussion in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. The paper is concluded in Section \ref{sec:conclusion} and Section \ref{sec:outlook} gives a brief outlook on future work.
