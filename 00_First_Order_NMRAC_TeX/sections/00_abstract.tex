\begin{abstract}
Lyapunov-based Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) is a well-known and widespread control strategy, that by design comes with stability guarantees. However, it does not allow for nonlinearities in the closed-loop system, which limits its application to linear systems with linear feedback controllers. In this work, a Lyapunov-based update mechanism for first-order systems controlled by neural network-based controllers (NNC) is proposed. The update mechanism is validated in simulation for a constant reference signal, a sinusoidal reference signal, and a smooth pulse signal. Promising numerical results show that the proposed algorithm converges towards the desired values and that the convergence speed can be tuned by manipulating the learning rate. Additionally, this work identifies numerical instabilities as a potential issue, which can be reduced by decreasing the sampling time. \newline
