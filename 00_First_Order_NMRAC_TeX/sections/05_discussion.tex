\section{Conclusion}
The simulation results of the scalar system indicate that the proposed update law successfully enables the system to learn the desired parameters across different reference signals. The speed of convergence can be controlled by adjusting the factor $c$, with smaller values leading to faster convergence. Additionally, this work identifies numerical instability as a potential issue. This instability can be reduced by lowering the sampling time, thus enhancing the precision of integral and derivative approximations, improving overall simulation accuracy.
