The algorithm is computationally simple, because of an effective exploitation of the structure of manipulator dynamics. In particular, it requires neither feedback of joint accelerations nor inversion of the estimated inertia matrix. The algorithm can also be applied directly in Cartesian space.},

This adaptive control scheme was used to control a relatively complex process like the {pH} of a solution in a tank reactor at laboratory level. For comparison purposes, some very well-known control strategies were also implemented, which include {PID} control and standard model reference adaptive control ({MRAC}). Tracking and regulation capabilities of the control strategies studied were analysed and compared. Experimental results indicate that {CMRAC} behaves as well as the standard {MRAC} and a very well-tuned {PID} for a specific and known operating point.

The controller structure can employ either a radial basis function network or a feedforward neural network to compensate adaptively the nonlinearities in the plant. A stable controller-parameter adjustment mechanism, which is determined using the Lyapunov theory, is constructed using a -modification-type updating law. The evaluation of control error in terms of the neural network learning error is performed. That is, the control error converges asymptotically to a neighborhood of zero, whose size is evaluated and depends on the approximation error of the neural network. In the design and analysis of neural network-based control systems, it is important to take into account the neural network learning error and its influence on the control error of the plant. Simulation results showing the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach are given.},

	abstract = {In the stability analysis of Model Reference Adaptive Control ({MRAC}), the Lyapunov’s direct method is usually used and this method only results in stability of the adaptive system. Until now, Barbalat’s Lemma, was commonly used to prove asymptotic convergence of the tracking error in these systems. One of the disadvantages of this Lemma is the imposition of strict condition of uniform continuity that restricts the use of this Lemma. In addition, this Lemma does not provide any result about convergence of adaptive gains. For this reason, until now it has been difficult and even mostly impossible to achieve the desired result of asymptotic stability for the {MRAC} by using methods based on the Barbalat’s Lemma. The new Theorem of Stability is a direct extension of the Lyapunov method, which under very simple initial conditions and without the need for uniform continuity yields to more comprehensive results for all the states of the adaptive system and even in some cases results in asymptotic stability. In this paper, first, the new Theorem of Stability and its benefits are described and then, the stability analysis of the {MRAC} is performed by this new method and under simple conditions, the result of asymptotic stability for this adaptive system is obtained which is a very desirable result. Simulation of a single-link flexible-joint robot with {MRAC} has confirmed the accuracy of the performed stability analysis.},

	abstract = {The {MIT} rule is a scalar parameter adjustment law which was proposed in 1961 for the model reference adaptive control of linear systems modeled as the cascade of a known stable plant and a single unknown gain. This adjustment law was derived by approximating a gradient descent procedure for an integral error squared performance criterion. For the early part of the 1960s this rule was the basis of many adaptive control schemes and a considerable wealth of practical experience and engineering folklore was amassed. The {MIT} rule is in general not globally convergent nor stable but has a performance determined by several factors such as algorithm gain, reference input magnitude and frequency, and the particular transfer function appearing in the cascade. These restrictions on the {MIT} rule slowly came to be discerned through experimentation and simulation but effectively were without theoretical support until some novel algorithm modifications and stability analysis, so-called Lyapunov redesign, due to Parks. Our aim in this paper is to pursue a theoretical analysis of the original {MIT} rule to support the existing simulation evidence and to indicate mechanisms for treating questions of robustness of {MIT}-rule-based adaptive controllers with undermodelling effects. The techniques that we apply to this problem centre on root locus methods, Nyquist methods and the application of the theory of averaging. Stability and instability results are presented and, using pertinent theories for different regimes of the gain-frequency plane, we approximate the experimentally derived stability margins, but for a broader signal class than simply periodic inputs. The mechanisms of instability and stability for these adaptive systems are highlighted and allow us to enunciate guidelines for the {MIT} rule to work. It is a pleasing by-product of this theoretical analysis that these guidelines coincide to a large degree with those advanced in earlier times on experimental and heuristic grounds.},

Readers will acquire a well-developed sense of when to use adaptive techniques and when other methods are more appropriate. Starting with a broad overview, the text explores real-time estimation, self-tuning regulators and model-reference adaptive systems, stochastic adaptive control, and automatic tuning of regulators. Additional topics include gain scheduling, robust high-gain control and self-oscillating controllers, and suggestions for implementing adaptive controllers. Concluding chapters feature a summary of applications and a brief review of additional areas closely related to adaptive control. Both authors are Professors at the Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden, and this text has evolved from their many years of research and teaching. Their insights into properties, design procedures, and implementation of adaptive controllers are complemented by the numerous examples, simulations, and problems that appear throughout the book.},

The main focus of research is on how to adapt the control actions more effectively to solve the problem of disturbances and non-linearities. Conventional-{MRAC} alone is unable to handle nonlinearities and disturbances of the plant and to provide a stable and controlled output, we augment an {NN} controller, in parallel with {MRAC} controller, to compensate the nonlinearities and disturbances present in the plant and this scheme is called as {NN}-{MRAC} scheme. All methods are applied with analytical detail to a chosen single-input/singleoutput ({SISO}) second order inherently unstable system named Inverted Pendulum with the application of some uncertainties and disturbances. It is clearly seen from the computer simulation results that {NN}-{MRAC} system improves the performance of the system effectively.},

The proposed robust generalized dynamic inversion control law comprised equivalent and switching control parts. The equivalent control part works to enforce a virtual constraint dynamics of the controlled state variables by means of Moore–Penrose generalized inversion. The switching control part is of the sliding mode type, and it improves robustness against unmodeled system dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances. The robust generalized dynamic inversion control design on the linearized model of the under-actuated rotary inverted pendulum is shown to guarantee semi-global asymptotically stable tracking performance. Numerous computer simulations and experiments are conducted on the Quanser rotary inverted pendulum system, revealing that the proposed algorithm has better convergence and tracking performance than conventional sliding mode and generalized dynamic inversion control strategies when both are applied separately.},

In this research, the Model Reference Adaptive Control ({MRAC}) using the Lyapunov stability theorem was applied in a two-wheeled robot. {MRAC} was used to design adaptive controllers that work on the principle of adjusting controller parameters so that the actual output traces the output of the reference model, which has the same reference input. The adjusting mechanism was built to ensure stability and convergence from the adaptation errors. The verification experiment showed that with the adaptation gain γ1, γ2, γ3 are 1, 0.005 and 0.001 respectively, the response could follow the reference model with a rising time and settling time 0.27 s and 0.87 s, respectively.},

In this paper, an intelligent control method is developed for stabilizing such the {RIP} system in upright posture. The controller is structured from a linear quadratic regulator ({LQR}) and an online radial basis function ({RBF}) Neural-Network compensator. The {LQR} term plays a crucial role in yielding the nominal control signal based on a linearized model. Meanwhile, the neural control term is adopted to suppress the systematic deviation and external disturbances as the system is far from the equilibrium state. A damping segment-wise adaptation rule is proposed to activate the network operation. Stability of the closed-loop system is then proven by Lyapunov analyses. Effectiveness and feasibility of the advanced controller are confirmed throughout comparative simulation and real-time experiments.},

Using the phase plane trajectories obtained from the angular and angular velocity oscillatory motion of the forearm, a target trajectory of the shoulder joint is calculated such that the mechanical energy of the forearm motion increases. We design a tracking control law for the shoulder joint with respect to a target trajectory. The maximum amplitude of the target trajectory directly restricts the angular motion of the actuator.

Linearization of the dynamics of the pendubot about this equilibrium results in a completely controllable system and allows a linear controller to be designed for local asymptotic stability. For the underactuated pendubot, the important task is, therefore, to design a controller that will swing up both links and bring the configuration variables of the system within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. This paper provides a new method for swing-up control based on a series of rest-to-rest maneuvers of the first link about its vertically upright configuration. The rest-to-rest maneuvers are designed such that each maneuver results in a net gain in energy of the second link. This results in swing-up of the second link and the pendubot configuration reaching the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium. A four-step algorithm is provided for swing-up control followed by stabilization. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.},

	abstract = {Want to know not just what makes rockets go up but how to do it optimally? Optimal control theory has become such an important field in aerospace engineering that no graduate student or practicing engineer can afford to be without a working knowledge of it. This is the first book that begins from scratch to teach the reader the basic principles of the calculus of variations, develop the necessary conditions step-by-step, and introduce the elementary computational techniques of optimal control. This book, with problems and an online solution manual, provides the graduate-level reader with enough introductory knowledge so that he or she can not only read the literature and study the next level textbook but can also apply the theory to find optimal solutions in practice. No more is needed than the usual background of an undergraduate engineering, science, or mathematics program: namely calculus, differential equations, and numerical integration. Although finding optimal solutions for these problems is a complex process involving the calculus of variations, the authors carefully lay out step-by-step the most important theorems and concepts. Numerous examples are worked to demonstrate how to apply the theories to everything from classical problems (e.g., crossing a river in minimum time) to engineering problems (e.g., minimum-fuel launch of a satellite). Throughout the book use is made of the time-optimal launch of a satellite into orbit as an important case study with detailed analysis of two examples: launch from the Moon and launch from Earth. For launching into the field of optimal solutions, look no further! .},

	abstract = {As a powerful method of solving the nonlinear optimal control problem, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming ({IADP}) is usually established on the known controlled system model and is particular for affine nonlinear systems. Since most nonlinear systems are complicated to establish accurate mathematical models, this paper provides a novel data-based approximate optimal control algorithm, named iterative neural dynamic programming ({INDP}) for affine and non-affine nonlinear systems by using system data rather than accurate system models. The {INDP} strategy is built within the framework of {IADP}, where the convergence guarantee of the iteration is provided. The {INDP} algorithm is implemented based on the model-based heuristic dynamic programming ({HDP}) structure, where model, action and critic neural networks are employed to approximate the system dynamics, the control law and the iterative cost function, respectively. During the back-propagation of action and critic networks, the approach of directly minimizing the iterative cost function is developed to eliminate the requirement of establishing system models. The neural network implementation of the {INDP} algorithm is presented in detail and the associated stability is also analyzed. Simulation studies are conducted on affine and non-affine nonlinear systems, and further on the manipulator system, where all results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed data-based approximate optimal control method.},

A supervised neural dynamic programming ({SNDP}) approach is developed to solve this {MRAC} problem, which includes a learning mode and a control mode. In the learning mode, a data-based adaptive critic learning algorithm is proposed, which guarantees that the controlled objective adaptively tracks the reference model on behavior. Such an algorithm also ensures flexible switching from the learning mode to the control mode under which the robustness of the closed-loop control systems is further improved. By employing a newly defined mode scheduler that regulates the learning mode and the control mode, the adaptation and the robustness of the systems are both achieved by the developed {SNDP} approach. Its uniformly ultimately bounded property is proved by using Lyapunov method. Simulation results verify that the developed {SNDP} approach ensures the adaptation to the variable reference input, and has superiority over some traditional {MRAC} methods in improving the robustness.},

To overcome these problems we propose a neural controller using

initialization parameters of the neural controller using reduced
number of observation. In the second phase, the parameters of the neural controller are directly tuned from the training data via the tracking error. The simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm using variable learning rate is simple to implement and may be extended to multivariable system.},

In the conventional {MRAC} scheme, the controller is designed to realize the plant output convergence to the reference model output based on the assumption that the plant can be linearized. This scheme is eﬀective for controlling a linear plant with unknown parameters in the ideal case. However, it may not be assured to succeed in controlling a nonlinear plant with unknown structures in the real case. We incorporate a neural network in the {MRAC} to overcome this problem. The control input is given by the sum of the output of the adaptive controller and the output of the {NN}. The {NN} is used to compensate for the nonlinearity of the plant that is not taken into consideration in the conventional {MRAC}. We developed an eﬃcient method for calculating the sensitivity of the plant that is utilized in the {NN} to perform the backpropagation algorithm very eﬃciently. The plant of the magnetic levitation system has inherent strong nonlinearities due to the natural properties of the magnetic ﬁelds and uncertainties. Therefore, to conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness of our proposed controller, we implemented our proposed controller in real time on an experimental test bed of a magnetic levitation system. Finally, experimental results veriﬁed that the proposed control strategy has the advantages of tracking desired output perfectly and reducing the error.},

The adaptation mechanism depends on the error between the plant output and the reference model output. In the corresponding control architecture, three neural networks are used as a reference model, a plant model and a controller. The approach is to first construct a plant model to identify the model of the controlled process, and then the controller is adaptively trained on-line to generate the control signal to force the process to follow a desired reference model.

	abstract = {Recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) are a class of nonlinear dynamical systems often used to model sequenceto-sequence maps. {RNNs} have excellent expressive power but lack the stability or robustness guarantees that are necessary for many applications. In this paper, we formulate convex sets of {RNNs} with stability and robustness guarantees. The guarantees are derived using incremental quadratic constraints and can ensure global exponential stability of all solutions, and bounds on incremental 2 gain (the Lipschitz constant of the learned sequence-to-sequence mapping). Using an implicit model structure, we construct a parametrization of {RNNs} that is jointly convex in the model parameters and stability certiﬁcate. We prove that this model structure includes all previouslyproposed convex sets of stable {RNNs} as special cases, and also includes all stable linear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of the proposed model class in the context of non-linear system identiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {A mix locally recurrent neural network was used to create a proportional-integral-derivative ({PID})-like neural network nonlinear adaptive controller for uncertain multivariable single-input/multi-output system. It is composed of a neural network with no more than three neural nodes in hidden layer, and there are included an activation feedback and an output feedback, respectively, in a hidden layer. Such a special structure makes the exterior feature of the neural network controller able to become a P, {PI}, {PD}, or {PID} controller as needed. The closed-loop error between directly measured output and expected value of the system is chosen to be the input of the controller. Only a group of initial weights values, which can run the controlled closed-loop system stably, are required to be determined. The proposed controller can update weights of the neural network online according to errors caused by uncertain factors of system such as modeling error and external disturbance, based on stable learning rate. The resilient back-propagation algorithm with sign instead of the gradient is used to update the network weights. The basic ideas, techniques, and system stability proof were presented in detail. Finally, actual experiments both of single and double inverted pendulums were implemented, and the comparison of effectiveness between the proposed controller and the linear optimal regulator were given.},

A novel pneumatic artificial muscle ({PAM}) actuator which has achieved increased popularity to provide the inherent safety and mobility assistance to humans performing tasks and another advantages such as high strength and power/weight ratio, low cost, compactness, ease of maintenance, cleanliness, readily available and cheap power source and so on. However, the complex nonlinear dynamics of the {PAM} manipulator makes it a challenging and appealing system for modeling and control design. The problems with the time variance, compliance, high hysteresis and nonlinearity of pneumatic systems have made it difficult to realize precise position control. In order to realize satisfactory control performance, the effect of nonlinear factors contained in the {PAM} manipulator must be considered. The purpose of this study is to improve the control performance of 2 axes {PAM} manipulator using a nonlinear {PID} controller. Superb mixture of conventional {PID} controller and the neural network, which has powerful capability of learning, adaptation and tackling nonlinearity, brings us a novel nonlinear {PID} controller using neural network. This proposed controller is appropriate for a kind of plants with nonlinearity uncertainties and disturbances. The experiments were carried out in practical 2 axes {PAM} manipulator and the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm was demonstrated through the experiments, which suggests its superior performance and disturbance rejection.},

The closed-loop properties amenable to the proposed technique include global and local stability, performance with respect to a given cost function (both in a deterministic and stochastic setting) and the L2 gain. The method applies to a wide range of practical control problems: For instance, a dynamical controller (e.g., a {PID}) plus input saturation, model predictive control with state estimation, inexact model and soft constraints, or a general optimization-based controller where the underlying problem is solved with a fixed number of iterations of a first-order method are all amenable to the proposed approach. The approach is based on the observation that the control input generated by an optimization-based controller satisfies the associated Karush–Kuhn–Tucker ({KKT}) conditions which, provided all data is polynomial, are a system of polynomial equalities and inequalities. The closed-loop properties can then be analyzed using sum-of-squares ({SOS}) programming.},

To provide such a guarantee, one must be able to bound the output of neural networks when their input changes within a bounded set. In this article, we propose a semideﬁnite programming ({SDP}) framework to address this problem for feed-forward neural networks with general activation functions and input uncertainty sets. Our main idea is to abstract various properties of activation functions (e.g., monotonicity, bounded slope, bounded values, and repetition across layers) with the formalism of quadratic constraints. We then analyze the safety properties of the abstracted network via the S-procedure and {SDP}. Our framework spans the tradeoff between conservatism and computational efﬁciency and applies to problems beyond safety veriﬁcation. We evaluate the performance of our approach via numerical problem instances of various sizes.},

First, we show that the stability and performance of a polynomial dynamical system controlled by a neural network with semialgebraically representable activation functions (e.g., {ReLU}) can be certified by convex semidefinite programming. The result is based on the fact that the semialgebraic representation of the activation functions and polynomial dynamics allows one to search for a Lyapunov function using polynomial sum-of-squares methods. Second, we remark that even in the case of a linear system controlled by a neural network with {ReLU} activation functions, the problem of verifying asymptotic stability is undecidable. Finally, under additional assumptions, we establish a converse result on the existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function for this class of systems. Numerical results with code available online on examples of state-space dimension up to 50 and neural networks with several hundred neurons and up to 30 layers demonstrate the method.},

	abstract = {Tight estimation of the Lipschitz constant for deep neural networks ({DNNs}) is useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of classifiers to stability analysis of closed-loop systems with reinforcement learning controllers. Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of {DNNs} both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program ({SDP}). The resulting {SDP} can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation).  We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the {MNIST} and Iris datasets. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.},

The method only requires the knowledge of a ﬁnite collection of one-step transitions of the discrete-time dynamics, without the requirement of segments of trajectories or the control inputs that eﬀected the transitions to be available. The approach uses a novel characterization of the {MPI} and {MCI} sets as the solution to an inﬁnite-dimensional linear programming ({LP}) problem in the space of continuous functions, with the optimum being attained by a (Lipschitz) continuous function under mild assumptions. The inﬁnitedimensional {LP} is then approximated by restricting the decision variable to a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and by imposing the non-negativity constraint of this {LP} only on the available data samples. This leads to a single ﬁnite-dimensional {LP} that can be easily solved using oﬀ-the-shelf solvers. We analyze the convergence rate and sample complexity, proving probabilistic as well as hard guarantees on the volume error of the approximations. The approach is very general, requiring minimal underlying assumptions. In particular, the dynamics is not required to be polynomial or even continuous (forgoing some of the theoretical results).

	abstract = {A neural net ({NN}) controller for a general serial-link robot arm is developed. The {NN} has two layers so that linearity in the parameters holds, but the "net functional reconstruction error" and robot disturbance input are taken as nonzero. The structure of the {NN} controller is derived using a filtered error/passivity approach, leading to new {NN} passivity properties. Online weight tuning algorithms including a correction term to backpropagation, plus an added robustifying signal, guarantee tracking as well as bounded {NN} weights. The {NN} controller structure has an outer tracking loop so that the {NN} weights are conveniently initialized at zero, with learning occurring online in real-time. It is shown that standard backpropagation, when used for real-time closed-loop control, can yield unbounded {NN} weights if (1) the net cannot exactly reconstruct a certain required control function or (2) there are bounded unknown disturbances in the robot dynamics. The role of persistency of excitation is explored.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) or drones have emerged as a ubiquitous and integral part of our society. They appear in great diversity in a multiplicity of applications for economic, commercial, leisure, military and academic purposes. The drone industry has seen a sharp uptake in the last decade as a model to manufacture and deliver convergence, offering synergy by incorporating multiple technologies. It is due to technological trends and rapid advancements in control, miniaturization, and computerization, which culminate in secure, lightweight, robust, more-accessible and cost-efficient {UAVs}. {UAVs} support implicit particularities including access to disaster-stricken zones, swift mobility, airborne missions and payload features. Despite these appealing benefits, {UAVs} face limitations in operability due to several critical concerns in terms of flight autonomy, path planning, battery endurance, flight time and limited payload carrying capability, as intuitively it is not recommended to load heavy objects such as batteries. As a result, the primary goal of this research is to provide insights into the potentials of {UAVs}, as well as their characteristics and functionality issues. This study provides a comprehensive review of {UAVs}, types, swarms, classifications, charging methods and regulations. Moreover, application scenarios, potential challenges and security issues are also examined. Finally, future research directions are identified to further hone the research work. We believe these insights will serve as guidelines and motivations for relevant researchers.},

These flying machines are capable of vertical take off and landing ({VTOL}) in helicopter mode and able to transition to high-speed forward flight in airplane mode and vice versa. This paper aims at helping engineers and researchers develop flight control systems for {VTOL} {UAVs}. To this end, a historical perspective first shows the technological advances in {VTOL} aircraft over the years. The main {VTOL} concepts and state-of-art flight control methods for {VTOL} {UAVs} are presented and discussed. This study shows both the common parts and the fundamental differences in the modeling, guidance, control, and control allocation for each hybrid-{VTOL}-{UAV} type. The open challenges and the current trends in the field are highlighted. These are namely: 1) augmenting or replacing classical controllers with data-driven methods such as neural networks and machine-learning-based controllers; 2) incorporating as much knowledge of the vehicle as possible into the flight controller, for example through model predictive control or model-based nonlinear controllers; 3) a trend towards finding a unified-control approach valid in all flight modes without the need to switch among flight controllers or to perform predefined-gain scheduling, and 4) the need to mitigate control complexity and available computing resources.},

Neural networks are trained online to learn unknown dynamics and disturbances acting on the system to reduce the error between the actual dynamics of the system and the nominal dynamics considered in the {MPC} algorithm. Online learning is based on two theorems which provide Lyapunov proofs and guarantees of convergence for the tracking error between the desired and the real dynamics. The results presented in this work show that the proposed online-learning algorithm yields significant improvements in the tracking of the desired trajectory, even in the case of a fault in one of the actuators. Simulations prove that this controller is suitable for a complex system such as the tilt-rotor {VTOL} {UAV}.},

The deﬁnition involves the Hilbert transform as a critical instrument to complexify realvalued signals since the notion of phase arises most naturally in the complex domain. The proposed nonlinear system phase, serving as a counterpart of L2-gain, quantiﬁes the passivity and is highly related to the dissipativity. It also possesses a nice physical interpretation which quantiﬁes the tradeoff between the real energy and reactive energy. A nonlinear small phase theorem is then established for feedback stability analysis of semi-sectorial systems. Additionally, its generalized version is proposed via the use of multipliers. These nonlinear small phase theorems generalize a version of the classical passivity theorem and a recently appeared linear time-invariant small phase theorem.},

	abstract = {Purpose To apply and simulate under different conditions, the combined model reference adaptive control ({CMRAC}) technique to control the pitch angle in a subsonic plane. Comparisons with the classical {PID} controller and the adaptive direct {MRAC} are also performed. Design/methodology/approach The methodology used in this work is the {CMRAC}. This is a relatively new adaptive control technique which combines the information coming from the identification procedure as well as that from the direct control scheme, and use it in the adaptive laws. The identification parameters and the controller parameters are simultaneously adjusted using the identification error, the control error and the so‐called close‐loop identification error. This combination has shown to improve the transient behavior of the adaptive systems. Findings This control scheme has been tested by simulation on a model of a {CESSNA} 182 plane, to control the pitch angle (longitudinal movement). The results have been compared with other control approaches such as the classical {PID} and the adaptive direct {MRAC}. Although the {PID} control satisfies all the control specifications as much as the {CMRAC}, it is not able to adapt when changes in the operating conditions occur, as in the case of the {CMRAC}. The direct {MRAC} does no perform well in this study. Research limitations/implications The implementation at practical level remains to be studied and analyzed, to verify the theoretical and simulation results presented here. Practical implications The main advantage of the proposed method is that it behaves well even under different operating conditions, which is one of the most important characteristics for an implementation at practical level. Originality/value It is the first time in the control literature that the {CMRAC} is applied to control the pitch angle of a plane in a longitudinal movement. The results are quite promising remaining the practical implementation to verify the performance of the proposed scheme under real conditions.},

	abstract = {A decentralized {PID} neural network ({PIDNN}) control scheme was proposed to a quadrotor helicopter subjected to wind disturbance. First, the dynamic model that considered the effect of wind disturbance was established via Newton-Euler formalism. For quadrotor helicopter flying at low altitude in actual situation, it was more susceptible to be influenced by the turbulent wind field. Therefore, the turbulent wind field was generated according to Dryden model and taken into consideration as the disturbance source of quadrotor helicopter. Then, a nested loop control approach was proposed for the stabilization and navigation problems of the quadrotor subjected to wind disturbance. A decentralized {PIDNN} controller was designed for the inner loop to stabilize the attitude angle. A conventional {PID} controller was used for the outer loop in order to generate the reference path to inner loop. Moreover, the connective weights of the {PIDNN} were trained on-line by error back-propagation method. Furthermore, the initial connective weights were identified according to the principle of {PID} control theory and the appropriate learning rate was selected by discrete Lyapunov theory in order to ensure the stability. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the controller can effectively resist external wind disturbances, and presents good stability, maneuverability and robustness.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) are widely used and demonstrated their power in many applications, such as computer vision and pattern recognition. However, the training of these networks can be time consuming. Such a problem could be alleviated by using efficient optimizers. As one of the most commonly used optimizers, stochastic gradient descent-momentum ({SGD}-M) uses past and present gradients for parameter updates. However, in the process of network training, {SGD}-M may encounter some drawbacks, such as the overshoot phenomenon. This problem would slow the training convergence. To alleviate this problem and accelerate the convergence of {DNN} optimization, we propose a proportional-integral-derivative ({PID}) approach. Specifically, we investigate the intrinsic relationships between the {PID}-based controller and {SGD}-M first. We further propose a {PID}-based optimization algorithm to update the network parameters, where the past, current, and change of gradients are exploited. Consequently, our proposed {PID}-based optimization alleviates the overshoot problem suffered by {SGD}-M. When tested on popular {DNN} architectures, it also obtains up to 50\% acceleration with competitive accuracy. Extensive experiments about computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark data sets, including {CIFAR}10, {CIFAR}100, Tiny-{ImageNet}, and {PTB}.

In this paper, an algorithm that combines {PID} control scheme and Model Reference Adaptive Control ({MRAC}) to autotune the controller parameters in real time when system performances change is proposed and applied to control of the {DC} electromotor drive. The algorithm modifies the traditional {PID} control scheme by replacing the error between the reference and the system output with the direct system output in the derivative part. Compared to the traditional {MRAC} approach, the algorithm is normalized so that a reference model can be easily generated given bandwidth requirement. To be practical for implementation, the algorithm also simplifies the transfer function of the speed open-loop as an integrator by adding a current inner loop. The results of simulation on a twoloop servo control system show that the adjusted controller parameters meet the system design very well. The algorithm was implemented on a test platform and the performance of the system was evaluated with a dynamic signal analyzer. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through the experimental results.},

The suggested adaptive {PID} controller is evaluated in the {MATLAB}/Simulink environment using sinusoidal and step signals as the desired outputs. In this paper, neural network {PID} controller is used for disturbance rejection. The artificial neural network enables parameter adjustments for the {PID} controller to be made in a dynamic manner.
